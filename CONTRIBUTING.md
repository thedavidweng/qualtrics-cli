# Contributing to qualtrics-cli

We love contributions! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new command, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.26.5 or later
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (auto-installs the toolchain via `mise install`)

### Build
```bash
mise run build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
mise run test
```

## Adding an Endpoint

1. **Service Layer**: Add the typed method in `internal/qualtrics/<domain>.go`.
2. **CLI Layer**: Add the Cobra command in `internal/cli/<domain>.go`. Ensure you handle the `--json` flag and use the standard `output.Renderer`.
3. **Endpoint Catalog**: Add the entry to `docs/endpoints.yaml`.
4. **Safety Layer**: If the command is a mutation, ensure you call `safety.Check` before execution.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure your code follows idiomatic Go patterns and is formatted with `gofumpt -extra`.
3. Run `mise run fmt` before committing — CI rejects unformatted code.
4. Run `mise run check` to run fmt, build, test, lint, and conventions.
5. Include tests for any new functionality.
6. Update documentation if you've added or changed a command.
7. Open a PR with a clear description of your changes.
